## OVERVIEW

Trinity College has a desktop application that is shared locally. They want to make this tool available to all researchers worldwide and, to do so, they decided to developed this web app.

This tool enables mainly to determine one important characteristic of a karst (underground water) system : its base flow (output data) from data uploaded (input data) to the website, such as date/flow/rain/...

Several methods are used to determine the base flow and can be compared. Other outputs are made available.

The website consists of two parts : 
   * Calculations [Test Driven Development]
   * Presentation of the outputs : data visualisation with dynamics charts [DC/Crossfilter/D3]
   
   

## WHO IS THIS WEBSITE FOR ?

This project aims to make available a scientific tool to hydrologists from universities as well as private companies.
