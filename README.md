# PROJECT TRINITY
PROJECT II - INTERACTIVE FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

## AUTHOR(S)

   * Xavier Astor
   
With the help of the Code Institute Staff.

## OVERVIEW

This website makes available a tool developed by Trinity College teams.
This tool enable to determine the "base flow" of a karst system (output) from data uploaded to the website, such as date/flow/rain (input).
Several methods are used to determine it and can be compared.
Other outputs are made available.

The website consist of two parts : 
   * Calculations [Test Driven Development]
   * Presentation of the outputs : dynamics charts [DC/Crossfilter/D3]

## WHO IS THIS WEBSITE FOR ?

This website aims to achieve two goals :

   * **Educational :** This project is the second in a list of five projects to develop skills in full stack web development. Its goal is to develop skills in the "interactive front end development".
   * **Professional :**  This project aims to make available a scientific tool to hydrologists from universities as well as private companies.
